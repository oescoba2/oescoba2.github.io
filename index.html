									<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>
											"Mathematics is the most beautiful and most powerful creation of the human spirit," Stefan Banach once beautifully stated. As a young boy, I was fascinated as I learned about mathematics and its application in the world. 
											It soon became something that I yearned for as it helped me analyze solve problems with precision, rigor, and critical thinking.
										</p>

										<p>
											I have found a true calling in taking complex real problems and turning them into bite-size pieces of math.
											I then bridge the gaps of what is yet unknown with a precise solution and quantitative analysis.
											This has often helped me earn the praise of being an innovator by using math to model the world and find solutions.

										</p>
											My passion for solving real world problems has led me across several industries and research projects, one of which I was able to publish. 
											My research has been in the field of engineering in the computational fluid dynamics as well as wildfire model optimization. 
											I also work with reinforcement learning in modeling attacks on electrical infrastructure. 
											For industry, I have leveraged mathematics to employ statistical analysis and machine learning to asses or build models in the Natural Language Processing area as well as image text extraction.

										<h3>ML Intern Developer | June 2024-Aug 2024</h3> 
											<p>
												I was able to work at Wells Fargo under the Analytics & Data Undergraduate Program (ADUP) in Minneapolis.
												ADUP gave me the opportunity to choose the sorts of projects I wanted to work in, and having had experience in ML from my previous role, I chose ML modeling and data analysis.
												Given the choices, I chose to go into the Advanced Data Analytics & Solutions team under Andy Chandler to work more on the NLP opportunities his team presented.
											</p>	

											<p>
												I formed part of 4 person intern-team that built 6 ML models comprised classification models and regressions.
												Our main task was to answer 2 questions: 1) Does the given dataset possess anything that is predictive for assessing project risks and timelines? 2) Given the assumption of 1, can ML or NLP help assess project risks and timelines?
											</p>

											<p>
												In answer to number 1, I looked at the given project dataset spanning 8 years to understand what we worked with and find features that a model could use. 
												Moreover, I spent time reading the overall policies and guidelines Wells Fargo established to work with the projects we had access to.
												My manager was very surprised that I would actually read the long documentation to find important ML features. 
												In his words, "No one does that."
												To me, I figured that the math must be applicable but that I had to find a way to connect it to the task by first understanding how a human would actually sort through the business project info.
												I cannot just tell a machine "Here is some project data, make sense of it" without first doing the exploration myself to see where the modeling and code can speed up the process as well as quantify what in the past Wells Fargo had attempted to do.
											</p>

											<p>
												I am happy to say that my reading of the documentation actually helped me tidentify important features and milestones that each project should, at least in theory, hit according to its risks.
												I related the information to the team who did their own digging and then led us to create a table explaining these potential features we were finding.
												The unfortunate downside of having dug through the documentation was that I found that the data contained a lot of error and variability.
												In speaking to another manager we met, Michelle Bellanger, I learned that most of the information we had while it had improved still was not all uniform nor was there a concrete way to mark how a project was doing as well as when timelines where changed.
												Thus, we had to work under the assumption that our dataset, of about 5000 business projects information, contained errors that we could fix or even find.
												So we decided to just extract what we found important in all the projects and assumed that those had no error.
											</p>

											<p>
												Once we found the features or predictors for future business projects, I dove into the realm of NLP text classification using the statistical approach.
												I also contributed the feature analysis of the models my 3 other friends worked on.
												In particular, I helped Cece in first testing out which features her random forest should look at.
												I also helped Otto understand and describe the nature of SKLearn linear regression model as that uses Ordinary Least Squares, which for our given data set may not be appropriate since the input also has errors.
											</p>

											<p>
												For my modeling in NLP, I tried out several models like Naive Bayes, Complement Naive Bayes, and LinearSVC (all from SKLearn).
												In the set up, I decided on using the common TfIDF. 
												In my initial EDA work, I found that the overall dataset had several repeated words that were meant to quantify the risk but were used quite liberally.
												As such, I decided for a minimum document frequency of 5 documents but a max of 65% of all documents. 
												Moreover, my ability to perform part-of-speech tagging was hindered as well as preprocessing ability. 
												Ultimately, I was able to get a work around for eliminating stopwords as well eliminating numbers from the documents.
												Pnina Veisberg, a manager in the NLP side of Wells Fargo, was able to check out my initial pre-processing and stated that since our dataset was very small the elimnation of numbers should be ok.
											</p>

											<p>
												My overall contribution were 2 NLP text classification models: risk classification model and a binary timeline classification model. 
												The risk classification model is meant to take in business project descriptions and classify the project to one of Wells Fargo's risk categories.
												In my EDA, I found that about 1/3 projects were classified into wrong risk categories that would in turn affect the given timelines to finish the project.
												My model ultimately was able to have a 77% accuracy in risk classification using a 7 fold cross validation scheme. 
												Despite having about 5000 business projects, I was only able to actually use 1,500 or so for the text classification as only those actually contained text. 
												Moreover, about 57% of those 1,500 projects were of lower risk categories so that more often than not my model would have struggle classifying higher risk projects appropriately.
											</p>

											<p>
												For the binary classification, the main goal was to take a given text description of a project and predict if given the description, the model would meet the timelines set by Wells Fargo on projects.
												Again, the text information was very volatile but even more so with projects that would meet timelines or not. 
												For this model, I worked with only 1,200 projects out of the 1,500 possible projects. 
												Moreover, 2 out of every 3 projects would not meet its given timelines so that my model was highly biased toward classifying a "No."
												My model achieved a 68% 7 fold cross validated accuracy.
											</p>

											<p>
												Overall, I was able to present my findings and suggestions to all of the team and higher managers that dealt with these specific business projects on my penultimate day of my internship.
												My main findings were that the data contained a lot of volatility and NLP is not yet adequate to predict any risks or binary timeline adherence.
												I suggested that they first need to standardize the text descriptions to where they do not use the same repetitive words to quantify risk or timeline adherence.
												Rather, they should look at being descriptive for each project and detailed enough so that each project can stand out as an individual project. 
											</p>

										<h3>ML & Data Science Student Engineer | April 2023-April 2024</h3>
											<p>
												I was able to work in the Family History Center, located in Lehi, UT, of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
												During my time at the center, I was able to work with a machine learning production model that extracts genealogical information from digital artifacts.
												The main goal was to improve the model's ability to correctly identify crucial information from the digital artifact that was needed to help create more online records in less serviced populations like Spanish speakers, Portuguese, and Hungarian.
											</p>
										
											<p>
												I initially helped identified error and improvement areas (primarily being name identification and spelling) of the model that helped increase the performance by around 20-30%.
												To do this, I created my own Python script that would take the genealogical information output, as a .txt, and compared it to manually extracted and curated information (i.e. data labels). 
												The script would then do various comparisons, like searching for biggest contiguous string, and perform basic statistical analysis to help identify areas of improvement.
											</p>

											<p>
												Furthermore, I also led efforts and meetings with a team of 3 data labelers in creating the data labels to help train the model. 
												My other responsibility was also documenting our findings and procedures to help further define the process of data labeling and data analysis of our team and role. 
												Because of how well I did, my manager, Jon, offered me a part-time extension towards the end of my internship that I could continue as I went into my then junior year of the ACME program.
												I happily continued the role and fulfilled the same responsibilities until the end of the internship.

											<h3>  Wildfire Model Optimization; BYU - Missoula Fire Lab (Sept 2024-Present)</h3>
													<p>
													  I also started this other project with Dr. Barker from the mathematics department in conjunction to his work with Missoula Fire Lab.
													  Wind is a big principal component of wildfires, but it is hard to model properly.
													  WindNinja is a software that uses two different models that can solve the wildfire ODEs in order to make a wind profile.
													  However, one method is really fast but inaccurate, whereas the other is accurate but very slow.
													  The main goal of the project is to find a way to perform spectral methods on current wildfire modling techniques where we can implement the Fourier Basis.
													  The next goal would be to implement the Fast Fourier Transform so that computational cost is truncated significantly with the hope of being able to run some of the more complex models in laptops of forest agents.
													  This would allow us to make wind modeling fast and accessible at the time of disasters.
													  I will be presenting my current work <b><a href="https://src.byu.edu/abstract/detail/8386">here</a> </b>.

											<h3>Nozzle Design using CFD; BYU Rocketry Club-Hybrid Rocket Research Team (Sep 2021-Aug 2023)</h3>
												<p>I joined the BYU Rocketry Club: Hybrid Rocket Research Team back in the fall of 2021. My friend Brennen invited me to come and at least see what the club was about.
													I am glad to say that the rest is history. 
													I have always had a big affinity to the cosmos and intricacies of astronautics and the engineering and mathematics contained therein. 
													Upon joining the club overseen by Dr. Gorrell, we were the recipients of a grant from the Utah-NASA Consortium of about $8,000 that was to be used to generate research for paraffin LOX hybrid fuel. 
													We created a design for a 12ft rocket that would reach a target of 10,000 ft and have a maiden voyage in the summer of 2022. 
													We (see below) were able to present our findings at the Utah-NASA Consortium 2022 Spring Conference and publish it in the Utah-NASA Consortium <b><a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1706&context=spacegrant">webpage</a> </b>.
												</p>
													<div class="image main"><img src="images/Rocketry_Club.JPG" alt="" /></div>
												<p>
													I was working within the propulsion subteam to create the LOX dome, combustion chamber, fuel grain, and nozzle.
													I was tasked with implementing a design for the nozzle configurations that would enable us to reach a target exit mach number of 3.1. 
													I studied the works of Gas Dynamics by Zucrow and learned more about the method characteristics employed for nozzle design.
													I was able to implement a Python3 script that would similate axisymmetric irrotational compressible flow given a throat area, radius of curvarture, desired exit mach number, and specific heat of the fluid. 
													The script would output two solutions: 1. Rao nozzle in 3D (using Matplotlib) and 2. a txt, csv, excel file of the nozzle characteristic points that would then be used to create a CAD model in SolidWorks. 
													I was later able to implement numerical methods for the transonic region analysis.
													The main goal of this was to better estimate the mach number achieved by the nozzle as well as better configure the mesh of the method of characteristics.

<h3>Career Goals and Interests</h3>
<b>"Without vision, the people perish,"</b> a wise man once stated. I do not have every detail of my life mapped, but I do have some aspirations I am 
trying to bring to fruition. The cosmos has always inspired me to search for more and be able to fail quickly and learn in order to arrive at the at the grand reward. 
Machine Learning
has taught me that the reward oft times requires one to have patience and diligence and a good plan and an keen eye for improvement.<br><br>

I have current plans to attend graduate school in mathematics, computer science,
or mechanical 
engineering, depending on type of industry I work in. Aerospace, while it has complicated math, it does require more hands on work as well as technical knowledge for design
and construction of vehicles and engines. Machine learning and data science requires the more heavy side of mathematics and graph and network theory to make use of 
algorithms and statistics to predict and model, even the computational heavy complutational fluid dynamics I currently do, but there is also quite a bit of CS in there as well. 
I am open to all three but do lean more
towards mathematics since I have been more in love with the complexity and difficutly of the engineering and machine learning problems because of the complex math they require. I plan on pursuing a 
Master's degree no later than 1 year after graduation and hope to do that at MIT. 
<br><br>
For work, I love to learn and always improve current processes as well as tackle on new problems. I hope to work in the Aerospace industry shortly after graduation and work in the design 
and analysis of rockets, spacecraft, and propulsion, most especially the thermodynamic side of engineering. But I am also open to aeronautics as I enjoy all things that fly. I love the complexity of 
the problems so much that 
my parents and friends usually describe me as having a fervent passion for rockets. If I could send myself to space, that would be great. <br><br>
I would then like to pivot to a Machine Learning Job that 
focuses more on the data analytics and modeling, with some research sprinkled in,  because I have always found that numbers tell a part of the story one cannot see with the naked eye unless
we sort out the data or predict it with good accuracy. <br><br>

Mathematics is the cornerstone of things that give me passion as well as being the cornerstone of all of STEM. I have many aspirations in a very demanding and technical field that seeks to
prove itself and ensure it is error free. But I resonate with President Kennedy in that <b>"[I] choose to go to the moon ... and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, 
because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of [my] energies and skills, because that challenge is one that [I am] willing to accept, one [I am] unwilling to postpone, and one which [I] 
intend to win, and the others, too."</b>
