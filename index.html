									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>  <b>"Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star, "</b> Clement Stone once stated. As a young boy, I took that to heart, watching the NASA channel 
										and yearning for the exploration of 
										the vastness of our atmosphere and galaxy around us, and became passionate about rockets, computational fluid dynamics, and Machine Learning,
										all encompassed in Applied and Computational Mathematics. <br><br>

										I have found a true calling in taking complex mathematically involved engineering problems and turning them into bite-size pieces 
										and then bridging the gaps of what is yet unknown with a precise solution.
										My current project deals with calculating nozzle and propulsion configurations for a hybrid rocket using a self-created Python 
										script of Computational Fluid Dynamics. The aim is to able to provide the best thrust and impulse for our Utah-NASA funded rocket. 
										<br><br>
										
										I also very much enjoy working in improving a production Machine Learning model that extracts genealogical information 
										from a digital input that will allow users to find family information much easier than sorting through records.

									<h2>Education</h2>

									I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis (ACME) from Brigham Young University.
									 My anticipated graduation date is in April 2025. As part of the program, I am obtaining an emphasis (a minor)
									in Aerospace Engineering and Machine Learning & Data Science. I wanted my emphasis to reflect my two biggest interests and give me foundational 
									and technical projects and experience to be better suited for highly technical roles.<br><br>
									
									<h3>Aerospace Engineering</h3>
									Currently, I am doing coursework in thermodynamics aimed at improving my first and second law analysis as well as improving my 
									thermodynamic system analysis. I will be taking a course in fluid mechanics next semester too. I also
									plan on pursuing further coursework in CAD design, heat transfer, computational fluid dynamics, and complete 
									the hybrid rocket engine capstone project with the Ira Fulton College of Mechanical Engineering my last year. <br><br>
								    
									<h3>Machine Learning & Data Science</h3>
									For machine leearning, I am currently taking a course on algorithms and approximations. I am learning about various data 
									structures, complexity analysis, and probability and sampling. Moreover, I am also doing a lab class
									that is focused on creating in Python3 the current material we are learning as well learning numerical optimization and other 
									important numerical linear algebra algorithms with a focus on images, networks, and data science that will add more to technical
									repertoire. In my last year, I will pursue
									courses focused on modeling, deep learning, and system controls.

										<h2>Current Projects and Activities</h2>
										<h4>BYU Rocketry Club: Hybrid Rocket Research Team (Sep 2021-Present)</h4>
									</header>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/Rocketry_Club.JPG" alt="" /></div>
									<p>I joined the BYU Rocketry Club: Hybrid Rocket Research Team back in the fall of 2021. My friend Brennen invited me to come and at least see
										 what the 
										club was about, and I am glad to say that the rest is history. I have always had a big affinity to the cosmos and intricacies of astronautics
										and the engineering and mathematics contained therein. Upon joining the club overseen by Dr. Gorrell, we were the recipients
										of a grant from the Utah-NASA Consortium of about $8,000 that was to be used to generate research for paraffin 
										LOX hybrid fuel. We created a design for a 12ft rocket that would reach a target of 10,000 ft and have a maiden voyage in the summer 
										of 2022. We (image of team given above) were able to present our findings at the Utah-NASA Consortium 2022 Spring Conference and publish it in the Utah-NASA Consortium <b><a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1706&context=spacegrant">webpage</a> </b>.
									    <br><br>
										I was working within the propulsion subteam to create the LOX dome, combustion chamber, fuel grain, and nozzle.
										I was tasked with implementing a design for the nozzle configurations that would enable us to reach a target exit mach number of 3.1. 
										I studied the works of Gas Dynamics by Zucrow and learned more about the method characteristics employed for nozzle design.
										I was able to implement a Python3 script that would similate axisymmetric irrotational compressible flow given a throat area, radius of curvarture, 
										desired exit mach number, and specific heat of the fluid. The script would output two solutions: 1. Rao nozzle
										in 3D (using Matplotlib) and 2. a txt, csv, excel file of the nozzle characteristic points that would then be used to create a CAD model in SolidWorks. 
										I am now currently working in implementing numerical methods for the transonic region and in recreating 
										the mesh using a more efficient method that considers a flow that does not become sonic at the throat and uses chemical chain reactions approximations.
										<br><br>
										Currently, our goal is to design a small scaled motor for the rocket since we had to resize the piping and increase the design because we had to purchase new parachutes 
										since the originals never came in and the pipes that were unable to be bent correctly given 
										our limited tools. I am working in creating the igniter for the test motor. Our goal is to have tested 
										the scaled motor by the end of the winter 2024 semester and have the rocket fly during my last year.

										<h4>Machine Learning (Present Job)</h4>
									</header>
									<p>Just this past April, I was given an incredible internship opportunity to work with the Church of Jesus of Christ of Latter-day Saints' 
										Family History department. The purpose of the internship was to help improve a production machine learning model the department is 
										trying to implement that extracts genealogical information from a digital input. The goal is to make genealogical information more 
										accessible to less serviced areas like Spanish speaking countries. I was tasked with improving and analyzing the model's accuracy as well as
										well as create the test data for the model. <br><br>
										I was able to create a Python3 script that would compare machine created data and compare that to the human created data. My manager became quickly 
										impressed at my skills as well as my skills to 
										organize the other interns and enthusiasm that I was given the opportunity to continue working with the department on a part-time basis during 
										my penultimate year in school. I am currently working on expanding the model's accuracy to other civil records as well as getting trained to 
										fine tune the model. I have enjoyed this opportunity as it has tested every bit of programming and logic knowledge that I posses in order 
										to be able to 
										work with image processing to decode the writings of 1800 and 1900s civil records and ensure the model performs optimally.
										It has become quite the brain teaser and blessing to me.

										<h4>ACME Class President (Sep 2023-Present) </h4>
									</header>
									<p>I have always seen leadership as a way of voicing the opinion of others but also as a way to 
										help myself bring about changes in my life that would lead to a better future. As such, I joined the ACME student advisory committe during the summer prior to my junior year to be able to learn more from the seniors and professors attending as well 
										as to be able to impact decisions that would be taken for my program. Shortly thereafter, I was able to be elected class president along with my friend
										Michael King as vicepresident. I have been able to further my own personal character because of this opportunity and have learned to work well with the director of the 
										program as well as with the senior class presidency who attend and some of the Mathematics Department staff. Because of this opportunity, I have been able to serve my 
										fellow classmates, who I consider all my friends, in improving the program and experience not just for us but for those that come. Michael and I are looking 
										into giving a voice to our friends but also ensure we have fun along the arduous road of a mathematician as well as ensure that those 
										that come for us have a much better experience than we did.

									<h2>Career Goals and Interests</h2>
									<b>"Without vision, the people perish,"</b> a wise man once stated. I do not have every detail of my life mapped, but I do have some aspirations I am 
									trying to bring to fruition. The cosmos has always inspired me to search for more and be able to fail quickly and learn in order to arrive at the at the grand reward. 
									Machine Learning
									has taught me that the reward oft times requires one to have patience and diligence and a good plan and an keen eye for improvement.<br><br>
									
									I have current plans to attend graduate school in mathematics, computer science,
									or mechanical 
									engineering, depending on type of industry I work in. Aerospace, while it has complicated math, it does require more hands on work as well as technical knowledge for design
									and construction of vehicles and engines. Machine learning and data science requires the more heavy side of mathematics and graph and network theory to make use of 
									algorithms and statistics to predict and model, even the computational heavy complutational fluid dynamics I currently do, but there is also quite a bit of CS in there as well. 
									I am open to all three but do lean more
									towards mathematics since I have been more in love with the complexity and difficutly of the engineering and machine learning problems because of the complex math they require. I plan on pursuing a 
									Master's degree no later than 1 year after graduation and hope to do that at MIT. 
									<br><br>
									For work, I love to learn and always improve current processes as well as tackle on new problems. I hope to work in the Aerospace industry shortly after graduation and work in the design 
									and analysis of rockets, spacecraft, and propulsion, most especially the thermodynamic side of engineering. But I am also open to aeronautics as I enjoy all things that fly. I love the complexity of 
									the problems so much that 
									my parents and friends usually describe me as having a fervent passion for rockets. If I could send myself to space, that would be great. <br><br>
									I would then like to pivot to a Machine Learning Job that 
									focuses more on the data analytics and modeling, with some research sprinkled therein,  because I have always found that numbers tell a part of the story one cannot see with the naked eye unless
									we sort out the data or predict it with good accuracy. <br><br>
									
									Mathematics is the cornerstone of things that give me passion as well as being the cornerstone of all of STEM. I have many aspirations in a very demanding and technical field that seeks to
									prove itself and ensure it is error free. But I resonate with President Kennedy in that <b>"[I] choose to go to the moon ... and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, 
									because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of [my] energies and skills, because that challenge is one that [I am] willing to accept, one [I am] unwilling to postpone, and one which [I] 
									intend to win, and the others, too."</b>
