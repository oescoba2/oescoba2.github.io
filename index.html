									<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>
											"Mathematics is the most beautiful and most powerful creation of the human spirit," Stefan Banach once beautifully stated. As a young boy, I was fascinated as I learned about mathematics and its application in the world. 
											It soon became something that I yearned for as it helped me analyze solve problems with precision, rigor, and critical thinking.
										</p>

										<p>
											I have found a true calling in taking complex real problems and turning them into bite-size pieces of math.
											I then bridge the gaps of what is yet unknown with a precise solution and quantitative analysis.
											This has often helped me earn the praise of being an innovator by using math to model the world and find solutions.

										</p>
											My passion for solving real world problems has led me across several industries and research projects, one of which I was able to publish. 
											My research has been in the field of engineering in the computational fluid dynamics as well as wildfire model optimization. 
											I also work with reinforcement learning in modeling attacks on electrical infrastructure. 
											For industry, I have leveraged mathematics to employ statistical analysis and machine learning to asses or build models in the Natural Language Processing area as well as image text extraction.
										</p>

										<p>

											Random Fact: My mother tongue is Spanish, and I can crack two eggs at a time, one each hand

										<h2>Recent Professional Experience</h2>
										<p>You can find a full list of my other internships on <b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscar-j-escobar/">LinkedIn</a></b>.</p>

										<h3>ML Intern Developer | June 2024-Present</h3>
											<p>
												I am currently working at Wells Fargo within the Customer Excellence Data & Analytics team in the Minneapolis, MN office.
												Wells Fargo gave me the opportunity to choose the sorts of projects I wanted to work in, and having had experience in ML from my previous role, I chose ML modeling and data analysis.
												That is how I landed within the intern team of CEDA.
											</p>	

											<p>
												Currently, I am collaborating in the design of an ML classification model that will take company data of business processes and then predict service level agreement adherence.
												To aid with this, I querying and performing data analysis within Wells Fargo Oracle and Teradata databases using Toad Data Point and Power BI.
												I am trying to find, clean, extract important model input features to help our model.
											</p>

											<p>
												Moreover, I am also looking to expand the model's ability by doing some NLP on the databases containing descriptions of the business processes to help the model predict risk levels in accordance to Wells Fargo risk policies and procedures.
												I am working at first doing some linear regressions on the given text to employ sentiment analysis to see if we can sort the text into two broad categories of risk.
												I also am taking initiative in project managing our team project for goals and milestones in our modeling process and product design.
											</p>

										<h3>ML & Data Science Student Engineer | April 2023-April 2024</h3>
											<p>
												I was able to work in the Family History Center, located in Lehi, UT, of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
												During my time at the center, I was able to work with a machine learning production model that extracts genealogical information from digital artifacts.
												The main goal was to improve the model's ability to correctly identify crucial information from the digital artifact that was needed to help create more online records in less serviced populations like Spanish speakers, Portuguese, and Hungarian.
											</p>
										
											<p>
												I initially helped identified error and improvement areas (primarily being name identification and spelling) of the model that helped increase the performance by around 20-30%.
												To do this, I created my own Python script that would take the genealogical information output, as a .txt, and compared it to manually extracted and curated information (i.e. data labels). 
												The script would then do various comparisons, like searching for biggest contiguous string, and perform basic statistical analysis to help identify areas of improvement.
											</p>

											<p>
												Furthermore, I also led efforts and meetings with a team of 3 data labelers in creating the data labels to help train the model. 
												My other responsibility was also documenting our findings and procedures to help further define the process of data labeling and data analysis of our team and role. 
												Because of how well I did, my manager, Jon, offered me a part-time extension towards the end of my internship that I could continue as I went into my then junior year of the ACME program.
												I happily continued the role and fulfilled the same responsibilities until the end of the internship.

											<h4>Nozzle Design using CFD; BYU Rocketry Club-Hybrid Rocket Research Team (Sep 2021-Aug 2023)</h4>
												<p>I joined the BYU Rocketry Club: Hybrid Rocket Research Team back in the fall of 2021. My friend Brennen invited me to come and at least see what the club was about.
													I am glad to say that the rest is history. 
													I have always had a big affinity to the cosmos and intricacies of astronautics and the engineering and mathematics contained therein. 
													Upon joining the club overseen by Dr. Gorrell, we were the recipients of a grant from the Utah-NASA Consortium of about $8,000 that was to be used to generate research for paraffin LOX hybrid fuel. 
													We created a design for a 12ft rocket that would reach a target of 10,000 ft and have a maiden voyage in the summer of 2022. 
													We (see below) were able to present our findings at the Utah-NASA Consortium 2022 Spring Conference and publish it in the Utah-NASA Consortium <b><a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1706&context=spacegrant">webpage</a> </b>.
												</p>
													<div class="image main"><img src="images/Rocketry_Club.JPG" alt="" /></div>
												<p>
													I was working within the propulsion subteam to create the LOX dome, combustion chamber, fuel grain, and nozzle.
													I was tasked with implementing a design for the nozzle configurations that would enable us to reach a target exit mach number of 3.1. 
													I studied the works of Gas Dynamics by Zucrow and learned more about the method characteristics employed for nozzle design.
													I was able to implement a Python3 script that would similate axisymmetric irrotational compressible flow given a throat area, radius of curvarture, desired exit mach number, and specific heat of the fluid. 
													The script would output two solutions: 1. Rao nozzle in 3D (using Matplotlib) and 2. a txt, csv, excel file of the nozzle characteristic points that would then be used to create a CAD model in SolidWorks. 
													I was later able to implement numerical methods for the transonic region analysis.
													The main goal of this was to better estimate the mach number achieved by the nozzle as well as better configure the mesh of the method of characteristics.
												</p>


										<h3>Current Activities</h3>
											<h4>ACME Class President (Sep 2023-Present) </h4>
												<p>
													I have always seen leadership as a way of voicing the opinion of others but also as a way to help myself bring about changes in my life that would lead to a better future. 
													As such, I joined the student advisory comittee of ACME (SACME) the summer leading my junior year to be able to learn more from the seniors and professors attending as well as to be able to impact decisions that would be taken for my program. 
													Shortly thereafter, literally by the voice of my peer, I was encouraged to run for class president.
													I was later elected class president along with my friend Michael King as Vicepresident. 

												</p>
												<p>
													I have been able to further my own personal character because of this opportunity and have learned to work well with the director of the program as well as with professors of the program and some of the Mathematics Department staff. 
													Because of this opportunity, I have been able to serve my fellow classmates, who I consider all my friends, in improving the program, its coursework, and experience not just for us but for those that come after us. 
													Michael and I were able to create a new study incentive to help us collaborate as classmates but also befriend the underclassmen of the program.
													The incentive is called snACME where we have a specific time for everyone in ACME (upperclassmen or underclassmen) to come together to socialize, enjoy a snack, stregthen the cohort model, and collaborate on the demanding math homework.
													This has helped the underclassmen also feel welcome and connected to the program even though they are not yet in a junior or senior cohort.

<h3>Career Goals and Interests</h3>
<b>"Without vision, the people perish,"</b> a wise man once stated. I do not have every detail of my life mapped, but I do have some aspirations I am 
trying to bring to fruition. The cosmos has always inspired me to search for more and be able to fail quickly and learn in order to arrive at the at the grand reward. 
Machine Learning
has taught me that the reward oft times requires one to have patience and diligence and a good plan and an keen eye for improvement.<br><br>

I have current plans to attend graduate school in mathematics, computer science,
or mechanical 
engineering, depending on type of industry I work in. Aerospace, while it has complicated math, it does require more hands on work as well as technical knowledge for design
and construction of vehicles and engines. Machine learning and data science requires the more heavy side of mathematics and graph and network theory to make use of 
algorithms and statistics to predict and model, even the computational heavy complutational fluid dynamics I currently do, but there is also quite a bit of CS in there as well. 
I am open to all three but do lean more
towards mathematics since I have been more in love with the complexity and difficutly of the engineering and machine learning problems because of the complex math they require. I plan on pursuing a 
Master's degree no later than 1 year after graduation and hope to do that at MIT. 
<br><br>
For work, I love to learn and always improve current processes as well as tackle on new problems. I hope to work in the Aerospace industry shortly after graduation and work in the design 
and analysis of rockets, spacecraft, and propulsion, most especially the thermodynamic side of engineering. But I am also open to aeronautics as I enjoy all things that fly. I love the complexity of 
the problems so much that 
my parents and friends usually describe me as having a fervent passion for rockets. If I could send myself to space, that would be great. <br><br>
I would then like to pivot to a Machine Learning Job that 
focuses more on the data analytics and modeling, with some research sprinkled in,  because I have always found that numbers tell a part of the story one cannot see with the naked eye unless
we sort out the data or predict it with good accuracy. <br><br>

Mathematics is the cornerstone of things that give me passion as well as being the cornerstone of all of STEM. I have many aspirations in a very demanding and technical field that seeks to
prove itself and ensure it is error free. But I resonate with President Kennedy in that <b>"[I] choose to go to the moon ... and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, 
because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of [my] energies and skills, because that challenge is one that [I am] willing to accept, one [I am] unwilling to postpone, and one which [I] 
intend to win, and the others, too."</b>
