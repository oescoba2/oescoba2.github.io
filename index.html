									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>  <b>"Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star, "</b> Clement Stone once stated. As a young boy, I took that to heart, watching the NASA channel 
										and yearning for the exploration of 
										the vastness of our atmosphere and galaxy around us, and became passionate about rockets, computational fluid dynamics, and Machine Learning. 
										All encompassed in Applied and Computational Mathematics. <br><br>

										I have found a true calling in taking complex mathematically involved engineering problems and turning them into bite-size pieces 
										and then bridging the gaps of what is yet unknown with a precise solution.
										My current project deals with calculating nozzle and propulsion configurations for a hybrid rocket using a self-created Python 
										script of Computational Fluid Dynamics. The aim is to able to provide the best thrust and impulse for our Utah-NASA funded rocket. 
										<br><br>
										
										I also very much enjoy working in improving a production Machine Learning model that extracts genealogical information 
										from a digital input that will allow users to find family information much easier than sorting through records.

									<h2>Education</h2>

									I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis (ACME) from Brigham Young University.
									 My anticipated graduation date is in April 2025. As part of the program, I am obtaining an emphasis (a minor)
									in Aerospace Engineering and Machine Learning. I wanted my emphasis to reflect my two biggest interests and give me foundational 
									and technical projects and experience to be better suited for highly technical roles.<br><br>
									
									<h3>Aerospace</h3>
									Currently I am doing coursework in Thermodynamics aimed at improving my first and second law analysis as well as improving my 
									thermodynamic system analysis. I will be taking a course in Fluid Mechanics next semester too. I also
									plan on pursuing further coursework in heat transfer, computational fluid dynamics, finite element analysis, and complete 
									the hybrid rocket engine capstone project with the Ira Fulton College of Mechanical Engineering my last year. <br><br>
								    
									<h3>Mathematics and Machine Learning</h3>
									For Machine Learning, I am currently taking a course on algorithms and approximations. I am currently learning about various Data 
									Structures, complexity analysis, and probability and sampling. Concurrently to this course, I am also doing a lab class
									that is focused on creating in Python3 the data structures we are learning as well learn numerical optimization and other 
									important numerical linear algebra algorithms with focus on to images, networks, and data science. In my last year, I will pursue
									courses focused on modeling, machine learning theory, and system controls.

										<h2>Current Projects and Activities</h2>
										<h4>BYU Rocketry Club: Hybrid Rocket Research Team</h4>
									</header>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/Rocketry_Club.JPG" alt="" /></div>
									<p>I joined the BYU Rocketry Club: Hybrid Rocket Research Team back in the fall of 2021. My friend Brennen invited me to come what the 
										club was about and the rest is history. I have always had a big affinity to the cosmos and intricacies of astronautics
										and the engineering and mathematics contained therein. At the time I joined, the club, overseen by Dr. Gorrell, was the recipient 
										of a grant from the Utah-NASA Consortium of about $8,000 that was to be used to generate research for paraffin 
										LOX hybrid fuel. We created a design for a 12ft rocket that would reach a target of 10,000 ft and have a maiden voyage in the summer 
										of 2022. We were able to present and publish our findings with the Utah-NASA consortium <b><a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1706&context=spacegrant">webpage</a> </b>
										in the spring of 2022 (image of team given above)<br><br>
										I was working within the propulsion subteam to create the LOX dome, combustion chamber, fuel grain, and nozzle.
										I was tasked with implementing a design for the nozzle configurations that would enable us to reach a target exit mach number of 3.1. 
										I studied the works of Gas Dynamics by Zucrow and learned more about the method characteristics employed for nozzle design.
										I was able to implement a Python3 script that would similate axisymmetric irrotational compressible given a throat area, radius of curvarture, 
										desired exit mach number, and specific heat of the fluid. The script would output two solutions: 1. Rao nozzle
										in 3D (using Matplotlib) and a txt or csv or excel file of the nozzle characteristic points that would then be used to create a CAD model in solid works. 
										I am now currently working in implementin numerical methods for the transonic region and in recreating 
										the mesh using a more efficient method as well that incorporates flow that does not become sonic at the throat and then use chemical chain reactions for
										 when the mixture is not ideal. 
										<br><br>
										Currently, our goal is to design a small scaled motor for the rocket since we had to resize the piping and increase the design due to new parachutes 
										that had to be purchased since the originals never came in and pipes that were unable to be bent correctly given 
										our limited tools. I am working in creating the igniter and do my own research to better implement the code. Our goal is to have tested 
										the scaled motor and have the rocket fly during my senior year. You can see ou

										<h4>Machine Learning (Current Job)</h4>
									</header>
									<p>Just this past April, I was given an incredible internship opportunity to work with the Church of Jesus of Christ of Latter-day Saints' 
										Family History department. The purpose of the internship was to help improve the production machine learning model the department is 
										trying to implement that would extract genealogical information from a digital input. The goal is to make genealogical information more 
										accessible to less serviced areas like Spanish speaking countries. I was tasked with improving the analyzing the model's accuracy as well as
										well as creating the test data for the model. <br><br>
										I was able to create a Python3 script that would compare machine created data and compare that to the human created data that I or other 
										people had created. My manager became quickly impressed at my skills as well as my skills to 
										organize the other interns and enthusiasm that I was given the opportunity to continue working with the department on a part-time basis during 
										my junior year in school. I am currently working on expanding the model's accuracy to other civil records as well as getting trained to 
										fine tune the model. I have enjoyed this opportunity as it has tested every bit of programming and logic knowledge that I posses to be able to 
										work with image processing to decode the writings of 1800 and 1900s civil records. It has become quite the thorn and blessing to me.

										<h4>ACME Class President </h4>
									</header>
									<p>I joined the ACME student advisory committe during the summer prior to my junior year to be able to learn more the seniors and juniors attending as well 
										as to be able to impact decisions that would taken for my program. I have always seen leadership as a way of voicing the opinion of others but also as a way to 
										help myself bring about changes in my life that would lead to a better future. Thus, I was able to be elected class president along with my friend
										Michael King as vicepresident. I have been able to further my own personal character because of this opportunity and have learned to work well with the director of the 
										program as well as with the senior class presidency who attend. Because of this opportunity, I have been able to serve my 
										fellow classmates, who I consider all my friends, in improving the program and experience not just for us but for those that come. Michael and I are looking 
										into giving a voice to our friends but also ensure we have fun along the arduous road of a mathematician as well as ensure that those 
										that come for us have a much better experience than we did.

									<h2>Career Goals and Interests</h2>
									<b>"Without vision, the people perish,"</b> a wise man once stated. I do not have every detail of my life mapped, but I do have some aspirations I am 
									trying to bring to fruition. The cosmos has always inspired me to search for more and be able to fail quickly and learn in order to arrive at the at the grand reward. 
									Machine Learning
									has taught me that the reward oft times one requires patience and diligence and a good plan. I have current plans to attend graduate school in mathematics, computer science,
									or mechanical 
									engineering, depending on type of industry I work in. Aerospace, while it has complicated math, it does require more hands on work as well as technical knowledge for design
									and construction of vehicles and engines. Machine learning and data analytics requires the more heavy side of mathematics and graph and network theory to make use of 
									algorithms and statistics to predict and model, even the computational heavy complutational fluid dynamics I currently do, but there is also quite a bit of CS in there as well. 
									As such, I am open to all three but have a leniency
									towards mathematics since I have been more in love with the complexity and difficutly of the engineering problems because of the complex math they require. I plan on pursuing a 
									Master's degree no later than 1 year after graduation and hope to do that at MIT. 
									<br><br>
									For work, I love to learn and always improve current processes as well as tackle on new problems. I hope to work in the Aerospace industry shortly after graduation and work in the design 
									and analysis of rockets, spacecraft, and propulsion, most especially the thermodynamic side of engineering. But I am also open to aeronautics as I enjoy all things that fly. I love the complexity of 
									the problems so much that 
									my parents and friends usually describe me for having a fervent passion for rockets. If I could send myself to space, that would be great. <br><br>
									I would then like to pivot to a Machine Learning Job that 
									focuses more on the data analytics side of things because I have always found that numbers tell a part of the story one cannot see with the naked eye unless
									we sort out the data. With all this experience, I would like to pursue a teaching aspect in my latter years so that the rising generation can truly see that <b> math is not hard; its glorious and laborious 
									but not hard. </b>
