									<h2>About Me (under construction)</h2>
										<p>
											People have described as a leader, innovator, and a helping hand. 
											I have oft found myself also thinking of my actions this way.
											I very much like to learn as much as possible and continue to learn to do the job right.
											But I do not learn just for the sake of amassing knowledge but to further improve things or make something new.
											Moreover, because of how much I learn, I usually then find myself in a position to be able to help others learn new things as well as leading teams since I often go help one-on-one so that those I work with often see me as a leader.
										</p>

											<b>"Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star, "</b> Clement Stone once stated. 
											As a young boy, I took that to heart and shot <br><br>

											I have found a true calling in taking complex mathematically involved engineering problems and turning them into bite-size pieces 
											and then bridging the gaps of what is yet unknown with a precise solution.
											My current project deals with calculating nozzle and propulsion configurations for a hybrid rocket using a self-created Python 
											script of Computational Fluid Dynamics. The aim is to able to provide the best thrust and impulse for our Utah-NASA funded rocket. 
											<br><br>
											
											I also very much enjoy working in improving a production Machine Learning model that extracts genealogical information 
											from a digital input that will allow users to find family information much easier than sorting through records. <br><br>

										<h3>ML Intern Developer | June 2024-Present</h3>
											<p>
												I am currently working at Wells Fargo within the Customer Excellence Data & Analytics team in the Minneapolis, MN office.
												Wells Fargo gave me the opportunity to choose the sorts of projects I wanted to work in, and having had experience in ML from my previous role, I chose ML modeling and data analysis.
												That is how I landed within the intern team of CEDA.
											</p>	

											<p>
												Currently, I am collaborating in the design of an ML classification model that will take company data of business processes and then predict service level agreement adherence.
												To aid with this, I querying and performing data analysis within Wells Fargo Oracle and Teradata databases using Toad Data Point and Power BI.
												I am trying to find, clean, extract important model input features to help our model.
											</p>

											<p>
												Moreover, I am also looking to expand the model's ability by doing some NLP on the databases containing descriptions of the business processes to help the model predict risk levels in accordance to Wells Fargo risk policies and procedures.
												I am working at first doing some linear regressions on the given text to employ sentiment analysis to see if we can sort the text into two broad categories of risk.
												I also am taking initiative in project managing our team project for goals and milestones in our modeling process and product design.
											</p>

										<h3>ML & Data Science Student Engineer | April 2023-April 2024</h3>
											<p>
												I was able to work in the Family History Center, located in Lehi, UT, of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
												During my time at the center, I was able to work with a machine learning production model that extracts genealogical information from digital artifacts.
												The main goal was to improve the model's ability to correctly identify crucial information from the digital artifact that was needed to help create more online records in less serviced populations like Spanish speakers, Portuguese, and Hungarian.
											</p>
										
											<p>
												I initially helped identified error and improvement areas (primarily being name identification and spelling) of the model that helped increase the performance by around 20-30%.
												To do this, I created my own Python script that would take the genealogical information output, as a .txt, and compared it to manually extracted and curated information (i.e. data labels). 
												The script would then do various comparisons, like searching for biggest contiguous string, and perform basic statistical analysis to help identify areas of improvement.
											</p>

											<p>
												Furthermore, I also led efforts and meetings with a team of 3 data labelers in creating the data labels to help train the model. 
												My other responsibility was also documenting our findings and procedures to help further define the process of data labeling and data analysis of our team and role. 
												Because of how well I did, my manager, Jon, offered me a part-time extension towards the end of my internship that I could continue as I went into my then junior year of the ACME program.
												I happily continued the role and fulfilled the same responsibilities until the end of the internship.

										<h3>Research & Projects</h3>

											<p>
												I will begin a research project during this coming fall that entails with computational fluid dynamics in modeling wild fires.
												The project will be under one of our ACME faculty: Dr. Barker.
												I am excited to join that upon the end of my internship.
											</p>

											<h4>Lab Developer: Reinforcement Learning & Statistical Analysis (Dec 2023-June 2024)</h4>
												<p>
													The ACME program, paraphrasing one of its founders, was created to bring relevant 21st century math into a degree so that students would be ready to tackle modern problems.
													But ACME only has about 10 years of infancy, as such roadbumps would be encountered.
												</p>

												<p>
													Serving under the student advisory council of ACME, SACME, (see below for that) I helped bring notice to the small lingering issues found within the course textbooks and lab materials that were not previously found.
													One of those first issues I voiced dealt with the material and problems a lab, called Sampling, meant to help us connect the content of Bayesian statistics we were taught.
													The original lab did not have clear connections to the material, so upon voicing the concern, I also offered to help fix it since I pitched in ideas based on what I had read from documentation of stats modules and material learned.
													Seeing that I also was doing very well in the material, I was then offered a teaching assistant job (normally offered after successful completion of junior year).
												</p>

												<p>
													As a TA, I researched the documentation of SciPy regarding their stats module to see how we could implement Bayensian stats into the lab.
													Moreover, I also read other articles in the pedagogy of statistics as, at least while going through it, I had an idea of what we had learned but was not very confident in it. 
													I am happy to say that I rewrote and rewrote countless of times the new material and statistics connection several times until it was reviewed and accepted by the graduate student TA.
													The new material contains an overview of statistics and explanation of parameter estimation.
													Moreover, it dives into Bayesian framework and theory as well as a comparison to that of Frequentist/Classical statistics.
													Lastly, I gave a working example to aid with the first two lab problems as well as provided further instruction on how to use PyMC for Bayesian work.
												</p>

												<p>
													The next "big" issue I worked was towards the end of our junior year but also what we all considered a random lab given sometime during the first 3 weeks of the winter semester of junior year.
													The last lab of ACME volume 2 deals with Markov decision processes (MDPs) and stochastic optimization but in the scope of its main application: reinforcement learning (RL). 
													I had voiced the concern that no one liked the lab as it seem to talk about material we were not taught (the theory of RL) but had an odd connections to MDPs.
													The lab also seemed fairly familiar to an earlier found in the ACME lab curriculum called Gymnasium that we all considered random as we never once again touched on the material, or so we thought.
												</p>

												<p>
													The purpose of the Gymnasium lab is to introduce the Python Gymnasium model that is used for reinforcement learning. 
													At least, the lab never did teach the theory and concepts behind reinforcement learning except just a quick definition since most of the lab dealt with working under certain environments.
													Then, when we come to the MDP lab at the very end of the junior core, we did not remember what we did in the Gymnasium lab.
													Thus, once my TA and friend, Jeddy, mentioned to me that the main idea being used was RL, I took it upon myself to fix it.
													To do this, I read the famous work of Sutton & Barto, the recent text of Krutz & Brunton, another text by Hu, and added several Medium articles readings to further expand my knowledge on RL.
												</p>

												<p>
													After several weeks of learning and testing my own learning, I wrote the new RL material of the ACME program.
									                Gymnasium maintains a lot of its old material but now has RL theory as well as an explanation on the RL framework and the divergence between model-free and model-based concepts.
													It mainly deals with model-free methods theory and use to help solve the famous Taxi environment of Gymnasium.
													Whereas, the last lab dealing with MDPs now focuses first on the mathematical theory learned and taught in our curriculum but then dives into the connection to the RL framework and model-based methods.
													Furthermore, it explains some of the challenges of working with both model-free and model-based methods as well as problems encountered overall within RL like the credit assignment problem.
													I hope to further expand this junior year curriculum into the senior labs specifically by implementing deep RL work and gradient descent methods. 
													I will be working on this after completion of the fall semester of senior core of ACME once I have taken an grad-student course on RL offered by our CS department.
												</p>


											<h4>BYU Rocketry Club-Hybrid Rocket Research Team (Sep 2021-Aug 2024)</h4>
												<p>I joined the BYU Rocketry Club: Hybrid Rocket Research Team back in the fall of 2021. My friend Brennen invited me to come and at least see what the club was about.
													I am glad to say that the rest is history. 
													I have always had a big affinity to the cosmos and intricacies of astronautics and the engineering and mathematics contained therein. 
													Upon joining the club overseen by Dr. Gorrell, we were the recipients of a grant from the Utah-NASA Consortium of about $8,000 that was to be used to generate research for paraffin LOX hybrid fuel. 
													We created a design for a 12ft rocket that would reach a target of 10,000 ft and have a maiden voyage in the summer of 2022. 
													We (see below) were able to present our findings at the Utah-NASA Consortium 2022 Spring Conference and publish it in the Utah-NASA Consortium <b><a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1706&context=spacegrant">webpage</a> </b>.
												</p>
													<div class="image main"><img src="images/Rocketry_Club.JPG" alt="" /></div>
												<p>
													I was working within the propulsion subteam to create the LOX dome, combustion chamber, fuel grain, and nozzle.
													I was tasked with implementing a design for the nozzle configurations that would enable us to reach a target exit mach number of 3.1. 
													I studied the works of Gas Dynamics by Zucrow and learned more about the method characteristics employed for nozzle design.
													I was able to implement a Python3 script that would similate axisymmetric irrotational compressible flow given a throat area, radius of curvarture, desired exit mach number, and specific heat of the fluid. 
													The script would output two solutions: 1. Rao nozzle in 3D (using Matplotlib) and 2. a txt, csv, excel file of the nozzle characteristic points that would then be used to create a CAD model in SolidWorks. 
													I was later able to implement numerical methods for the transonic region analysis.
													The main goal of this was to better estimate the mach number achieved by the nozzle as well as better configure the mesh of the method of characteristics.
												</p>


										<h3>Current Activities</h3>
											<h4>ACME Class President (Sep 2023-Present) </h4>
												<p>
													I have always seen leadership as a way of voicing the opinion of others but also as a way to help myself bring about changes in my life that would lead to a better future. 
													As such, I joined the student advisory comittee of ACME (SACME) the summer leading my junior year to be able to learn more from the seniors and professors attending as well as to be able to impact decisions that would be taken for my program. 
													Shortly thereafter, literally by the voice of my peer, I was encouraged to run for class president.
													I was later elected class president along with my friend Michael King as Vicepresident. 

												</p>
												<p>
													I have been able to further my own personal character because of this opportunity and have learned to work well with the director of the program as well as with professors of the program and some of the Mathematics Department staff. 
													Because of this opportunity, I have been able to serve my fellow classmates, who I consider all my friends, in improving the program, its coursework, and experience not just for us but for those that come after us. 
													Michael and I were able to create a new study incentive to help us collaborate as classmates but also befriend the underclassmen of the program.
													The incentive is called snACME where we have a specific time for everyone in ACME (upperclassmen or underclassmen) to come together to socialize, enjoy a snack, stregthen the cohort model, and collaborate on the demanding math homework.
													This has helped the underclassmen also feel welcome and connected to the program even though they are not yet in a junior or senior cohort.

<h3>Career Goals and Interests</h3>
<b>"Without vision, the people perish,"</b> a wise man once stated. I do not have every detail of my life mapped, but I do have some aspirations I am 
trying to bring to fruition. The cosmos has always inspired me to search for more and be able to fail quickly and learn in order to arrive at the at the grand reward. 
Machine Learning
has taught me that the reward oft times requires one to have patience and diligence and a good plan and an keen eye for improvement.<br><br>

I have current plans to attend graduate school in mathematics, computer science,
or mechanical 
engineering, depending on type of industry I work in. Aerospace, while it has complicated math, it does require more hands on work as well as technical knowledge for design
and construction of vehicles and engines. Machine learning and data science requires the more heavy side of mathematics and graph and network theory to make use of 
algorithms and statistics to predict and model, even the computational heavy complutational fluid dynamics I currently do, but there is also quite a bit of CS in there as well. 
I am open to all three but do lean more
towards mathematics since I have been more in love with the complexity and difficutly of the engineering and machine learning problems because of the complex math they require. I plan on pursuing a 
Master's degree no later than 1 year after graduation and hope to do that at MIT. 
<br><br>
For work, I love to learn and always improve current processes as well as tackle on new problems. I hope to work in the Aerospace industry shortly after graduation and work in the design 
and analysis of rockets, spacecraft, and propulsion, most especially the thermodynamic side of engineering. But I am also open to aeronautics as I enjoy all things that fly. I love the complexity of 
the problems so much that 
my parents and friends usually describe me as having a fervent passion for rockets. If I could send myself to space, that would be great. <br><br>
I would then like to pivot to a Machine Learning Job that 
focuses more on the data analytics and modeling, with some research sprinkled in,  because I have always found that numbers tell a part of the story one cannot see with the naked eye unless
we sort out the data or predict it with good accuracy. <br><br>

Mathematics is the cornerstone of things that give me passion as well as being the cornerstone of all of STEM. I have many aspirations in a very demanding and technical field that seeks to
prove itself and ensure it is error free. But I resonate with President Kennedy in that <b>"[I] choose to go to the moon ... and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, 
because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of [my] energies and skills, because that challenge is one that [I am] willing to accept, one [I am] unwilling to postpone, and one which [I] 
intend to win, and the others, too."</b>
